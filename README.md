# books-grossman-white

2019 Software Design project. Forked over from the class repository to preserve it. Done in cooperation with Kate Grossman

This project essentially took two CSV files with authors and books and 1 CSV file that linked the authors with books and allowed the user to search and sort the books using the command line.
