class BooksDataSource:
    '''
    A BooksDataSource object provides access to data about books and authors.
    The particular form in which the books and authors are stored will
    depend on the context (i.e. on the particular assignment you're
    working on at the time).

    Most of this class's methods return Python lists, dictionaries, or
    strings representing books, authors, and related information.

    An author is represented as a dictionary with the keys
    'id', 'last_name', 'first_name', 'birth_year', and 'death_year'.
    For example, Jane Austen would be represented like this
    (assuming her database-internal ID number is 72):

        {'id': 72, 'last_name': 'Austen', 'first_name': 'Jane',
         'birth_year': 1775, 'death_year': 1817}

    For a living author, the death_year is represented in the author's
    Python dictionary as None.

        {'id': 77, 'last_name': 'Murakami', 'first_name': 'Haruki',
         'birth_year': 1949, 'death_year': None}

    Note that this is a simple-minded representation of a person in
    several ways. For example, how do you represent the birth year
    of Sophocles? What is the last name of Gabriel García Márquez?
    Should we refer to the author of "Tom Sawyer" as Samuel Clemens or
    Mark Twain? Are Voltaire and Molière first names or last names? etc.

    A book is represented as a dictionary with the keys 'id', 'title',
    and 'publication_year'. For example, "Pride and Prejudice"
    (assuming an ID of 132) would look like this:

        {'id': 193, 'title': 'A Wild Sheep Chase', 'publication_year': 1982}

    '''

    def __init__(self, books_filename, authors_filename, books_authors_link_filename):
        ''' Initializes this data source from the three specified  CSV files, whose
            CSV fields are:

                books: ID,title,publication-year
                  e.g. 6,Good Omens,1990
                       41,Middlemarch,1871


                authors: ID,last-name,first-name,birth-year,death-year
                  e.g. 5,Gaiman,Neil,1960,NULL
                       6,Pratchett,Terry,1948,2015
                       22,Eliot,George,1819,1880

                link between books and authors: book_id,author_id
                  e.g. 41,22
                       6,5
                       6,6

                  [that is, book 41 was written by author 22, while book 6
                    was written by both author 5 and author 6]

            Note that NULL is used to represent a non-existent (or rather, future and
            unknown) year in the cases of living authors.

            NOTE TO STUDENTS: I have not specified how you will store the books/authors
            data in a BooksDataSource object. That will be up to you, in Phase 3.

            QUESTION: Should Python interfaces specify TypeError?
            Raises TypeError if author_id, start_year, or end_year is non-None but not an integer.
            Raises TypeError if search_text or sort_by is non-None, but not a string.
				OUR ANSWER: Not for this assignment.

            QUESTION: How about ValueError? And if so, for which parameters?
            Raises ValueError if author_id is non-None but is not a valid author ID.
				OUR ANSWER: Yes, but just for author_id.
